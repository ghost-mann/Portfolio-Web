            Hi there! My name is Austin Oketch, and I'm a fourth-year computer science student pursuing a Bachelor's degree.During my time in college, I've had the opportunity to take a variety of courses that have helped me build a strong foundation in computer science. I have learned programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++, and have gained experience with data structures, algorithms, and software development methodologies.
            In terms of my career aspirations, I hope to work as a software engineer after graduation. I'm excited about the prospect of developing innovative software solutions that can make a difference in people's lives. I'm also interested in exploring the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning, which have the potential to transform many industries.
           </p>
