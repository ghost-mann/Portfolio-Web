        <p>

            As a Data Engineer, my primary goal is to design, build, and maintain the infrastructure necessary to support data-driven applications and processes. With a strong background in computer science and data management, I bring technical skills and expertise to ensure that data is available, accessible, and accurate for all users.
            My experience includes working with various data storage technologies such as SQL and NoSQL databases, Hadoop, Spark, and cloud-based platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure. I am familiar with ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, data modeling, and data warehousing concepts.
